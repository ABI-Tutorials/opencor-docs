The FileOrganiserWindow plugin allows you to organise your files in a virtual manner, i.e. independently of where they are physically located. Your virtual environment is remembered from one session to another and is originally empty:

Now, say that you are working on a specific project. You might then want to create a (virtual) folder, which contains (a virtual link to) all the files you need for your project. For this, you first need to click on the |folder-new| button in the toolbar (or use the context menu). This will add a folder to your virtual environment:

    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :alt: FileOrganiserWindow plugin: create a folder

You can rename the folder as you wish, as well as create other (sub-)folders, if needed:

    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :alt: FileOrganiserWindow plugin: create several (sub-)folders

You can also move the (sub-)folders around by dragging and dropping them within your virtual environment, or delete an existing (sub-)folder by clicking on the |edit-delete| button in the toolbar (or by using the context menu):

.. image:: ../resources/images/plugins/FileOrganiserWindowScreenshot04.png
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :alt: FileOrganiserWindow plugin: move/delete (sub-)folders

Next, you might want to open the :ref:`File Browser <OpenCOR-plugin-filebrowserwindow>` window, so you can start dragging and dropping files into your virtual environment (alternatively, you can use your system's file manager):

    :width: 60%
    :alt: FileOrganiserWindow plugin: add files

As for folders, you can move and delete your (virtual) files:

    :width: 60%
    :alt: FileOrganiserWindow plugin: move/delete files
