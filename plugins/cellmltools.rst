==================

The CellMLTools plugin consists of various `CellML <http://cellml.org>`_\ -related tools, which can be accessed through the :guilabel:`Tools` menu.

CellML File Export To...
========================

These tools can be used to export a CellML model to various formats:

* **CellML 1.0:** to flatten a CellML 1.1 model.
* **User-defined format:** to export a CellML model to some user-defined format.

.. note::
   The CellML 1.0 export is adapted from `Jonathan Cooper's CellML 1.1 to 1.0 converter <http://www.cellml.org/tools/jonathan-cooper-s-cellml-1-1-to-1-0-converter/versionconverter-tar.bz2/view>`_ and therefore has the same limitations.
